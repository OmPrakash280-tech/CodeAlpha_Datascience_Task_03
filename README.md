**Predictive Modeling with Linear Regression**

This project aims to build a predictive model using linear regression to forecast a numerical outcome based on one or more features. The model is constructed and evaluated using Python, and the entire process is documented in a Jupyter notebook.

**Overview**

Linear regression is a fundamental technique in predictive modeling, providing insights into relationships between variables and enabling forecasts of continuous outcomes. This project demonstrates the application of linear regression to a dataset with a continuous target variable, showcasing the steps of data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

**Features**

* Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset for modeling.
* Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualize relationships between features and the target variable.
* Linear Regression Model: Build and train a linear regression model to predict the target variable.
* Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
  
**Technologies Used**
  
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
